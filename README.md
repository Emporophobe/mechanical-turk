Stockfish UCI Interface

This project is an interface for the Stockfish chess engine. It allows a user to play against Stockfish and view the game on the command line. It is currently being developed and does not have several important features.

#### Current interface
Moves are assumed to be in long algebraic notation, eg e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6.
To make a move, simply enter a move in the prompt:

\>\>\> f3g5

Other commands include:
board - prints out the current board position
moves - prints out the move list for the game
quit - exit the program

#### To build
Download and unzip. Run 'make' in the directory. Launch program with ./mechturk
